# Instructions for Calculating TDMs and Zeeman Structure

Make sure to follow these steps carefully to calculate the theoretical values of Transition Dipole Moments (TDMs) and the Zeeman structure of the excited state as described in the paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16144v1" target="_top">[arXiv:2303.16144v1]</a>.

1. **Zeeman Structure for Excited State (Fig. 2(b)):**
   - Run the `zeeman.nb` file following the instructions provided within.

2. **Data for Fig. 3(a):**
   - Run the first evaluation cell of `excitedstate_TDMs.nb` and follow the instructions provided in the notebook.

3. **Data for Fig. 3(b):**
   - Run the first evaluation cell of `groundstate_TDMs.nb` following the provided instructions in the notebook.

4. **Data for Fig. 5(a):**
